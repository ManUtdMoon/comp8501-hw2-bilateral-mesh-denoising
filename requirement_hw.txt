b. Mesh Denoising

(1) Implement a Mesh Denoising algorithm;

(2) Use the implemented algorithm to denoise mesh in a 3D model;

(3) To test the algorithm, you can add noise to the existing model with Blender, or you may consider the scanned dataset. Here is a list of scanned datasets you may be interested in:

Requirements:

1. Please accomplish ONE of the three tasks;

2. Recommended programming languages: C++/Java/Python/MATLAB;

3. Technical report (printed as pdf), resource data (e.g. 3D model, texture map), source code and instruction file are expected to be submitted in Moodle;

4. In your technical report, you should cover your implementation details, present your results, and evaluate them via comprehensive discussion. Also, please give proper references.
